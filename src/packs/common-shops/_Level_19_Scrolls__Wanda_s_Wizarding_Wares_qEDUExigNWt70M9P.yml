          <p>This small, heart-shaped amulet appears to be sculpted from stone
          with a single streak of dim light running through, like an ember just
          beneath ashes. When worn, the amulet gives off a gentle warmth, akin
          to being near a fireplace. You gain poison resistance 15 when wearing
          this amulet.</p>

          <p>When you invest the amulet, you either increase your Constitution
          score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher
          score.</p>

          <p>You hold the amulet aloft as a ripple of warm orange light exudes
          outward. Each ally in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30] regains
          [[/r 30[healing]]]{30 Hit Points} and gains a +3 status bonus to

          <p>This string of beads appears to be a hemp string with lustrous red
          beads of various sizes hanging from it. When activated, it briefly
          appears in its true form: a golden chain with golden spheres attached
          by fine threads.</p>

          <p>This necklace has one [[/r 18d6[fire]]] damage, three [[/r
          16d6[fire]]] damage and five [[/r 14d6[fire]]] damage beads with a
          @Check[type:reflex|dc:39|basic:true|showDC:all] save. When all the

          <p><strong>Effect</strong> You detach a sphere from the necklace,
          causing it to glow with orange light. After you activate a sphere, if
          you or anyone else hurls it (an Interact action with the ranged
          trait), it detonates as a
          <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.sxQZ6yqTn0czJxVd]{Fireball}</em>
          where it lands. Your toss can place the center of the fireball
          anywhere within 70 feet, though at the GM's discretion you might need
          to make an attack roll if the throw is unusually challenging. If no
          one hurls the sphere by the start of your next turn, it turns into a
          non-magical red bead.</p>

          you imbibe the concoction, you can unleash a silver dragon's breath

          on the age of the dragon whose blood was used to make the potion.</p>

          <p>Exhaling dragon breath uses a single action. You create a

          /><p>Casting a Spell from a scroll requires holding the scroll in one
          hand and activating it with a Cast a Spell activity using the normal
          number of actions for that spell.</p>

          <p>To Cast a Spell from a scroll, the spell must appear on your spell
          list. Because you're the one Casting the Spell, use your spell attack
          roll and spell DC. The spell also gains the appropriate trait for your
          tradition (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).</p>

          <p>Any physical material components and costs are provided when a
          scroll is created, so you don't need to provide them when Casting a
          Spell from a scroll. You must replace any required material component
          for that spell with a somatic component. If the spell requires a
          focus, you must have that focus to Cast the Spell from a scroll.</p>

          using the normal number of actions for that spell.</p>

          <p>To Cast a Spell from a scroll, the spell must appear on your spell
          list. Because you're the one Casting the Spell, use your spell attack
          roll and spell DC. The spell also gains the appropriate trait for your
          tradition (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).</p>

          <p>Any physical material components and costs are provided when a
          scroll is created, so you don't need to provide them when Casting a
          Spell from a scroll. You must replace any required material component
          for that spell with a somatic component. If the spell requires a
          focus, you must have that focus to Cast the Spell from a scroll.</p>

          /><p>Casting a Spell from a scroll requires holding the scroll in one
          hand and activating it with a Cast a Spell activity using the normal
          number of actions for that spell.</p>

          <p>To Cast a Spell from a scroll, the spell must appear on your spell
          list. Because you're the one Casting the Spell, use your spell attack
          roll and spell DC. The spell also gains the appropriate trait for your
          tradition (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).</p>

          <p>Any physical material components and costs are provided when a
          scroll is created, so you don't need to provide them when Casting a
          Spell from a scroll. You must replace any required material component
          for that spell with a somatic component. If the spell requires a
          focus, you must have that focus to Cast the Spell from a scroll.</p>

          spell from the compendium or compendium browser into the inventory of

              <ul>

              <li>Vegetation springs up from every surface, giving each target a
              -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed any time it's adjacent
              to the plants and fungi.</li>

              <li>Aggressive animals attack unpredictably. At the start of its
              turn, each target rolls a @Check[type:flat|dc:8]. On a failure,
              it's attacked by swarming creatures that deal 2d10 slashing
              damage. The target attempts a basic Reflex save, and it is
              @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard}
              for 1 round on any outcome other than a critical success.</li>

              <li>The target loses any connection to nature or natural
              creatures. The target has to succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:5]
              when casting any primal spell or the spell fails. Furthermore,
              animal, fungus, and plant creatures become hostile to it, even one
              with a strong bond to the target, such as an animal
              companion.</li>

              </ul>

              <p>The GM might decide that you can't subject some creatures, such
              as an emissary of a nature deity, to the ire of nature.</p>

              tribute to you by bowing or using some other action in keeping
              with your appearance. The number of times a target must do this
              depends on the result of their Will save. Paying tribute is a
              manipulate action or move action, as chosen by the creature paying
              tribute. A creature under this effect must pay tribute to you at
              least once on each of its turns if possible. While affected by
              this spell, a creature is
              @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AdPVz7rbaVSRxHFg]{Fascinated}
              by you and can't use hostile actions against you. The target is
              then temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p>

              <hr /><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.

              <p><strong>Success</strong> The target must pay tribute twice.</p>

              <p><strong>Failure</strong> The target must pay tribute six
              times.</p>

              <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, and the target
              must spend all its actions paying tribute if possible.</p>

          holding the scroll in one hand and activating it with a Cast a Spell
          activity using the normal number of actions for that spell.</p>

          <p>To Cast a Spell from a scroll, the spell must appear on your spell
          list. Because you're the one Casting the Spell, use your spell attack
          roll and spell DC. The spell also gains the appropriate trait for your
          tradition (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).</p>

          <p>Any physical material components and costs are provided when a
          scroll is created, so you don't need to provide them when Casting a
          Spell from a scroll. You must replace any required material component
          for that spell with a somatic component. If the spell requires a
          focus, you must have that focus to Cast the Spell from a scroll.</p>

              <p>You conjure a towering mansion up to four stories tall and up
              to 300 feet on a side. While Casting the Spell, you hold an image
              of the mansion and its desired appearance in your mind. The
              mansion can contain as many or as few rooms as you desire, and it
              is decorated as you imagine it. You can imagine a purpose for each
              room of the mansion, and the proper accouterments appear within.
              Any furniture or other mundane fixtures function normally for
              anyone inside the mansion, but they cease to exist if taken beyond
              its walls. No fixture created with this spell can create magical
              effects, but magical devices brought into the mansion function
              normally.</p>

              <p>Your mansion contains the same types and quantities of
              foodstuffs and servants as created by the
              <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.vPWMEyVTreMOoFnm]{Magnificent

              <p>Each of the mansion's exterior doorways and windows are

              <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.4WAib3GichxLjp5p]{Alarm}</em>
              spells. You choose whether each alarm is audible or mental as you
              Cast the Spell, and each has a different sound (for an audible
              alarm) or sensation (for a mental one), allowing you to instantly
              determine which portal has been used.</p>

              <p>You momentarily summon an army of powerful dragons that unleash
              annihilating blasts as they descend upon your location. These
              dragons act as one and collectively occupy the space of a
              Gargantuan creature. They have a fly Speed of 100 feet. When you
              Cast this Spell, choose whether it summons chromatic or metallic
              dragons.</p>

              <p><strong>Arrive</strong> (evocation) <em>Energy
              Annihilation</em> The draconic legion breathes out two blasts of
              energy: a @Template[type:line|distance:120] and a
              @Template[type:cone|distance:60] that can't overlap. Each creature
              in either of the areas takes 10d8 damage (basic Reflex save). The
              dragons choose the damage type of each breath weapon, depending on
              the category of dragons summoned. Chromatic dragons can choose
              cold, fire, or poison for the cone and acid or electricity for the
              line; metallic dragons can choose cold or fire for the cone and
              acid, electricity, or fire for the line.</p>

              <p><strong>Depart</strong> <em>Draconic Whirlwind</em> The
              draconic legion strikes with fury, dealing [[/r 9d8[slashing]]]
              damage (basic Reflex save) to all enemy creatures in its location
              or within 20 feet.</p>

      <p>Nobody really knows what Wanda originally looked like, but now she is
      always a bit different or sometimes another ancestry entirely when you
      find another of her shops. The Wizarding Wares franchise has shown up and
      disappeared in most cities inside empty buildings that are left renovated
      when the store disappears. The store itself is unremarkable, were it not
      for the back room that is connected to a plane of treasure and
      craftsmanship.</p>

      <p>Wanda is rumoured to be the richest and most eccentric person in the
      world and it has been proven that she can be in multiple places at the
      same time. Not once has an appearance of one of her shops been predicted
      or observed and some pray to her as a goddess of commerce. She can have
      many different attitudes, but most often appears as a sweet old lady or as
      a bombastic businesswoman that has the skill and experience to drive up
      prices to impossible heights in an auction.</p>
