          <p>This string of beads appears to be a hemp string with lustrous red
          beads of various sizes hanging from it. When activated, it briefly
          appears in its true form: a golden chain with golden spheres attached
          by fine threads.</p>

          <p>This necklace has one @Damage[18d6[fire]|traits:area-damage]
          damage, three @Damage[16d6[fire]|traits:area-damage] damage and five
          @Damage[14d6[fire]|traits:area-damage] damage beads with a
          @Check[type:reflex|dc:39|basic:true|showDC:all] save. When all the
          beads are gone, the necklace becomes a non-magical hemp string.</p>

          <p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class="action-glyph">A</span>
          Interact</p>

          <hr />

          <p><strong>Effect</strong> You detach a sphere from the necklace,
          causing it to glow with orange light. After you activate a sphere, if
          you or anyone else hurls it (an Interact action with the ranged
          trait), it detonates as a
          @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.sxQZ6yqTn0czJxVd]{Fireball}
          where it lands. Your toss can place the center of the fireball
          anywhere within 70 feet, though at the GM's discretion you might need
          to make an attack roll if the throw is unusually challenging. If no
          one hurls the sphere by the start of your next turn, it turns into a
          non-magical red bead.</p>

          <p>Casting a Spell from a scroll requires holding the scroll in one
          hand and activating it with a Cast a Spell activity using the normal
          number of actions for that spell.</p>

          <p>The spell must appear on your spell list. Because you're the one
          Casting the Spell, use your spell attack modifier and spell DC. The
          spell also gains the appropriate trait for your tradition (arcane,
          divine, occult, or primal).</p>

          <p>Any physical costs are provided when a scroll is created, so you
          don't need to provide them when casting from a scroll. If the spell
          requires a locus, you must have that locus to Cast the Spell from a
          scroll.</p>

              <p>Choose a single statement you want the targets to believe. The
              fact could be narrow, such as "a dragon is circling overhead and
              wants to kill me"; wide-reaching, such as "all humanoids are
              disguised abominations"; or conceptual, such as "if I don't live a
              kinder life, I'll be punished in the afterlife." The targets'
              experiences color how they react to this "truth" and how their
              behavior changes. If the statement changes what they perceive,
              they treat the change as a sudden revelation. The effect of the
              spell depends on the targets' Will saves. If a target is already
              affected by fabricated truth, your spell tries to counteract it.
              If the counteract check fails, the outcome of the target's saving
              throw can't be worse than a success.</p>

              <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target doesn't believe

              statement or realize you tried to trick it.</p>

              <p><strong>Failure</strong> The target believes the statement for
              1 week.</p>

              <p>Animals, plants, and fungi in the area turn against the
              targets. Each target suffers from the following effects as long as
              it remains in the area.</p>

              <ul>

              <li>Vegetation springs up from every surface, giving each target a
              -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed any time it's adjacent
              to the plants and fungi.</li>

              <li>Aggressive animals attack unpredictably. At the start of its
              turn, each target rolls a @Check[type:flat|dc:8]. On a failure,
              it's attacked by swarming creatures that deal 2d10 slashing
              damage. The target attempts a basic Reflex save, and it is
              @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard}
              for 1 round on any outcome other than a critical success.</li>

              <li>The target loses any connection to nature or natural
              creatures. The target has to succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:5]
              when casting any primal spell or the spell fails. Furthermore,
              animal, fungus, and plant creatures become hostile to it, even one
              with a strong bond to the target, such as an animal
              companion.</li>

              </ul>

              <p>The GM might decide that you can't subject some creatures, such
              as an emissary of a nature deity, to the ire of nature.</p>

              <p>You conjure a towering mansion up to four stories tall and up
              to 300 feet on a side. While Casting the Spell, you hold an image
              of the mansion and its desired appearance in your mind. The
              mansion can contain as many or as few rooms as you desire, and it
              is decorated as you imagine it. You can imagine a purpose for each
              room of the mansion, and the proper accouterments appear within.
              Any furniture or other mundane fixtures function normally for
              anyone inside the mansion, but they cease to exist if taken beyond
              its walls. No fixture created with this spell can create magical
              effects, but magical devices brought into the mansion function
              normally.</p>

              <p>Your mansion contains the same types and quantities of
              foodstuffs and servants as created by the
              @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.vPWMEyVTreMOoFnm]{Planar
              Palace} spell.</p>

              <p>Each of the mansion's exterior doorways and windows are
              protected by
              @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.4WAib3GichxLjp5p]{Alarm}
              spells. You choose whether each alarm is audible or mental as you
              Cast the Spell, and each has a different sound (for an audible
              alarm) or sensation (for a mental one), allowing you to instantly
              determine which portal has been used.</p>

          <p>Casting a Spell from a scroll requires holding the scroll in one
          hand and activating it with a Cast a Spell activity using the normal
          number of actions for that spell.</p>

          <p>The spell must appear on your spell list. Because you're the one
          Casting the Spell, use your spell attack modifier and spell DC. The
          spell also gains the appropriate trait for your tradition (arcane,
          divine, occult, or primal).</p>

          <p>Any physical costs are provided when a scroll is created, so you
          don't need to provide them when casting from a scroll. If the spell
          requires a locus, you must have that locus to Cast the Spell from a
          scroll.</p>

          <p>Casting a Spell from a scroll requires holding the scroll in one
          hand and activating it with a Cast a Spell activity using the normal
          number of actions for that spell.</p>

          <p>The spell must appear on your spell list. Because you're the one
          Casting the Spell, use your spell attack modifier and spell DC. The
          spell also gains the appropriate trait for your tradition (arcane,
          divine, occult, or primal).</p>

          <p>Any physical costs are provided when a scroll is created, so you
          don't need to provide them when casting from a scroll. If the spell
          requires a locus, you must have that locus to Cast the Spell from a
          scroll.</p>

          <p>Embroidered with fine silver thread in ornate arcane patterns,
          these robes come in one of three colors depending on their attuned
          alignment. Good robes are gold, neutral robes are light blue, and evil
          robes are red. An evil or good robe gains the appropriate trait. The
          robes benefit only characters who can cast arcane spells and whose
          alignment on the good-evil axis matches that of the robe. If your
          alignment does not match that of the robe, or you are not an arcane
          spellcaster, you are instead
          @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied
          2} while wearing a <em>robe of the archmagi</em>. This condition can't
          be removed in any way until you remove the robe.</p>

          <p>The robes are <em>+2 greater resilient explorer's clothing</em>,
          and they grant a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against arcane
          spells and resistance 10 to damage from arcane spells.</p>

      <p>Nobody really knows what Wanda originally looked like, but now she is
      always a bit different or sometimes another ancestry entirely when you
      find another of her shops. The Wizarding Wares franchise has shown up and
      disappeared in most cities inside empty buildings that are left renovated
      when the store disappears. The store itself is unremarkable, were it not
      for the back room that is connected to a plane of treasure and
      craftsmanship.</p>

      <p>Wanda is rumoured to be the richest and most eccentric person in the
      world and it has been proven that she can be in multiple places at the
      same time. Not once has an appearance of one of her shops been predicted
      or observed and some pray to her as a goddess of commerce. She can have
      many different attitudes, but most often appears as a sweet old lady or as
      a bombastic businesswoman that has the skill and experience to drive up
      prices to impossible heights in an auction.</p>
